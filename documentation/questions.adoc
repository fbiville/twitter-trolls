== Answering Questions With Cypher

Let's explore how can construct Cypher queries to answer questions that we have of the data:

1. Start with a question.
1. Define the graph pattern that we're interested in. *What piece of the graph do I have to traverse to answer this question?*
1. Whiteboard this if it helps
1. Write that pattern using Cypher's graph ASCII-art
1. Add predicate filters `WHERE.. CONTAINS, IN, =, ...`
1. Add aggregations (`COUNT, SUM, AVG, ...`) as necessary
1. Select data to `RETURN`
